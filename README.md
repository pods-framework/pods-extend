<strong>This plugin has been incorpated into Pods 2.5.5 and is no longer needed. You can safely deactivate it. Your settings will be preserved.</strong>

Supports custom post types, Pods extended posts and pages, as well as custom taxonomies.

Requires Pods 2.3.18 or later.

This plugin was created using [Pods Extend](https://github.com/pods-framework/pods-extend), the new Pods Plugin starter plugin, as part of [a series of tutorials on creating Pods Plugins](http://pods.io/tutorials/creating-pods-plugins/).

Instructions
============
For complete instructions see [http://pods.io/tutorials/creating-pods-plugins/using-pods-display/](http://pods.io/tutorials/creating-pods-plugins/using-pods-display/)

In the Pods editor, under the "Frontier Auto Display Options" tab, click the "Enable Automatic Pods Templates for this Pod?" option.

New fields will be revealed: "Single item view template" and "Archive view template" as well as fields to set the location for the template. In these fields enter the name of Pods Templates that you wish to use in each case and whether you want it to appear before, after or in place of the post content.

The "Single item view template" option sets the Pods Template used for individual post pages and the "Archive view template" option sets the Pods Template used for the list of posts in the custom post type. For taxonomies only the "Archive view template" option will be shown.

NOTE: Archives for custom post types must be enabled under the "Advanced Options" tab using the option "Enable Archive Page". By default archives are not enabled.
